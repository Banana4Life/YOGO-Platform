Platform

#YOGO Platform is our first entry to Ludum Dare. We decided to enter in the Jam, because we wanted to pull this project of as a team.
Sadly we decided only one day before the event started to enter it and so we had no preparation. Also we had no experience with Slick 2D.

What worked:
- We actually "finished" a "game" in one weekend :D
- The graphics are not the worst we have ever seen

Where we failed:
- The first idea was dumped 15 hours in
- The idea that we used was not well elaborated
- We made no plan
- The code is total crap and patched-up like hell :) 

For our first time in Ludum Dare we were pretty successful, since we finished a game and we are confident, that we do better next time. :)

Controls:
- left arrow key : move left
- right arrow key: move right
- space         : activate platform 

Description:
#YOGO Platform is about a platform(you) that tries to save the last robot out of a burning factory building, 
that is constantly trying to jump in the fire below your platform.
To fulfill this quest you can activate your platform by pressing "SPACE". But watch your power bar, so you do not run out of power.
Collect the falling yellow batteries to fill your power bar and avoid the falling white batteries, that take power from your power bar.
